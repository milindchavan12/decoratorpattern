# Decorator Pattern

A Decorator is a structural design pattern which allows us to extend the behavior of objects by placing these objects into a special wrapper class. The Decorator design pattern is quite popular in C# due to the fact that it helps us dynamically add behaviors to the wrapped objects.

The structure of this pattern consists of a Component class and a Concrete Component class from one part and a Decorator class and a Concrete Decorator class on the other side. The Concrete Decorator class is going to add additional behavior to our Concrete Component.
